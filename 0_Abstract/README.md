# Abstract
In todays automobile environment high end cars and certain heavy goods transport vehicles are fitted with expensive automatic windshield wipers where the maintenance
and troubleshooting posed major problems. wipers play a key role during adverse weather conditions by wiping the rain continuously over the windshield area and provides a clear vision to the driver. Wipers are designed and made to clear the water from a windscreen. The windshield wiper system of passenger cars comprises three major subsystems: two wipers and their arms; a mechanism; and an electric motor.The concept of this proposed wiper system is similar with other existing conventional wiper. A wiper generally consists of a metal arm; one end pivots, the other end has a long rubber bladeattached to it. The wiper serves to clean the windshield of the car at the front and rear, although not all cars have wipers on the rear side. Wiper works by removing oil, dust, rainwater, and dirt that get stuck to the windshield.
