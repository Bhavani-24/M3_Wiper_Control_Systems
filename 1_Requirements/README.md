# Aim
Car glass that is exposed to dirt or rainwater will usually be cleaned using a wiper. Usually, the wiper is attached to the front and rear sides. With the wiper, the driver’s view will not be hindered and so they can see clearly towards the front or rear. Wipers do have a very important role in the safety of the riders because wiper performance is closely related to the safety of driving.

# Objectives
- The main objective is to design and manufacture a new mechanism to cover the complete area of the wind screen.
- The main purpose of the wiper system is to clean the windscreen sufficiently to provide suitable visibility at all times.
- At present, engineers are investigating fully automated systems that vary the speed of the wiper blades according to the rate of the rainfall and the speed of the vehicle.
- The systemcontains a microcontroller that takes in the input signals from the sensors and controls the operation of the windshield wipers based on those input signals.

# Introduction
wipers are manual systems that work on the principle of manual switching. So here we propose an automatic wiper system that automatically switches ON on detecting rain and stops when rain stops. Our project brings forward this system to automate the wiper system having no need for manual intervention. For this purpose we use rain sensor along with microcontroller to drive the wiper motor. 

## Wiper working
Our system uses rain sensor to detect rain, this signal is then processed by microcontroller to take the desired action. The rain sensor works on the principle of using water for completing its circuit, so when rain falls on it it’s circuit gets completed and sends out a signal to the microcontroller. The microcontroller now processes this data and controls the motor.This system is equally useful for Aircrafts and a smaller version of this can be used by motor bikers in their helmets so that they can drive easily in rains. When the wiper switch is in the off position, the wiper will not function. When the wiper switch is in low-speed mode, the wiper will work at low speed. Accordingly, when the wiper switch is in high-speed mode, the wiper will work at a fairly high speed.
Now that you hopefully understand how the car wiper works, along with its components and detail functions, you should take care of it as well as possible and be diligent in cleaning it!

## What
- A windshield wiper system comprises a wiper drive and two wiper arms.

## When
- The wiper starts to turn on, the wiper motor will rotate the crank arm and this will make the connecting rods pull and push each other.

## Where
- wiper blade is a device used to remove rain,dust particles,snow ice...etc.

## Who
- wiper system is used to clean windscreen sufficiently to provide visibility to drive all the times.

## How
- Windshield wipers are operated by an electric motor.The electric motor is attached to a worm gear, which transmits the necessary force to a long rod that sets the wiper arms in motion. When the wiper switch is in the off position, the wiper will not function. When the wiper switch is in low-speed mode, the wiper will work at low speed. Accordingly, when the wiper switch is in high-speed mode, the wiper will work at a fairly high speed.

# SWOT Analysis
## strengths                                                            
electronic and speed control reduced noise at blade reversal points.   
Reduced weight of the motor and size of the motor.                    
Enhanced driver comfort reduced noise from wiper operation.            

## weakness
Additional cost is required to install this system for four wheelers.
It is not applicable for two wheelers.
This system applied in the case of water falling on the glass only.

## Opportunities
The wiper system of a vehicle is an integrated system that is used to remove rain, dust, oil from a windscreen or windshield.
it greatly makes the visibility and affets the safety of passengers and the vehicles also.

## Treats
A Wiper Attack involves wiping/overwriting/removing data from the victim.
